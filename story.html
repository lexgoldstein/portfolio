      <h1>San Francisco public artworks aim to uplift city character and community, deter vandalism  </h1>

        Even concrete jungles need a little color to shine. Walking through the hilly streets of San Francisco, one will surely come across alleys with what seem like never-ending murals, vibrant skate parks or perhaps a massive artistic sculpture miraculously balanced next to the bay. </p>

       <p>The city is now adding to its extensive public art portfolio with over a dozen artistic fixtures. The beautification project of The Great Highway outlines plans for murals, sculptures and interactive installations to line a two-mile stretch of the throughway. The final brushstroke on a 60-foot-long mural tentatively introduced as “A History of Play” by local artist Emily Fromm is set to grace the wall in mid-March.</p>
        
       <p>San Francisco’s affinity for the arts is nothing new. Since the New Deal era and the signing of the 1932 San Francisco Charter, the Arts Commission has had jurisdiction over city art and responsibility to care for works in the Civic Art Collection. In 1969, the Art Enrichment Ordinance program required that 2% of funds for proposed public structures, parks and transportation projects must be allocated to public art commissions. Similarly the “1%-For-Art” program requires projects over 25,000 square feet in the downtown as well as surrounding areas to put 1% of total construction cost towards public art installation. </p>

       <p>With these longstanding commitments to artistic merit city-wide, it is not surprising that the large-scale project is attracting so many local artists. </p>
       <p>San Franciscans have also been inspired to create through the StreetSmARTS program through Public Works, which brings together private property owners, the city and local artists to enhance neighborhood character through new murals that also work to deter rising rates of vandalism. When given a graffiti notice, private property owners are given the option to participate in the StreetSmARTS in addition to removal.</p>
    
       <p>Shared space means shared responsibility, but it also offers opportunity for community-building. Many of the public arts murals registered in StreetSmARTS depict the struggles and joys of marginalized communities in San Francisco. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU7UGzqeztEqaQ6qyFkNrlW34WCXL6h504YGNb_XktA/edit?usp=sharing">More than half of the murals painted between 2009 and 2020 are in cultural districts</a>.</p>

<! This Flourish map utilizes a color-blind friendly color combo of orange and blue. I embedded it, like the other Flourish visualizations, using the embed div Flourish provided when I published it. -->

      <p>
        The commitment to caring for shared spaces has welcomed artistic movements. The pandemic-born San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency program “Slow Streets” created low-vehicle-traffic routes for community building, encouraging walking and biking. Soon after, SFMTA piloted a mural program, and unveiled the first “Slow Streets” mural in July 2024.

      <p> San Francisco may be known for its choice in paint strips — from The Golden Gate Bridge to The Painted Ladies and the numerous iconic murals in the Mission District — but the city has also taken to 3-D art.</p>
      <p>Of the 65 proposed public works in the “1%-For-Art” program from 2017-2024, over half were some type of sculpture. Bronze appears to be the hot, new artistic medium, with  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gsrclhkPY6KLqnDqRpOojlgoUnoa-eerZCzZKKkvlek/edit?usp=sharing">35% of proposed projects, mainly sculptures, featuring the metal</a>.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco Arts Commission commissioned a $1.5 million dollar metal sculpture titled “Node” as part of its Central Subway Public Art Program. The 2023 addition to San Francisco’s public sculpture portfolio speaks to the city’s commitment to 2-D, 3-D and interactive art support — no matter the price tag. 
    </p>
    <p>San Francisco locals and public art fanatics can expect more exciting public work unveilings to come soon as The Great Highway beautification project continues.

<! I made a seperate tag with transparency so that I could make it a smaller font size that the rest of the body text. This signaled the end of the article and introduction of my own commentary.-->
    <div id="transparency">I got all of my data through the San Francisco Open Data portal, and I used three spreadsheets to provide data insights and visualizations to accompany my story. For the first spreadsheet on murals painted between 2009-2020 in San Francisco, I cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns and split the location points into separate columns (latitude and longitude). I then made a pivot table to find out how many of the murals were in each of the city’s cultural districts in addition to a pivot table outlining how many murals were in each San Francisco neighborhood, which I used to make a gradient map in Flourish. For the proposed public works spreadsheet, I cleaned the data by removing unnecessary and incomplete columns, as well as fixing header typos and sorting out unnecessary data. I made pivot tables to track what mediums were considered for use in the art, what type of art forms were being proposed, and which artists were being commissioned more than once for projects. I also used a geojson file of San Francisco neighborhoods with the neighborhood pivot table to finish the Flourish map outline.</div>
