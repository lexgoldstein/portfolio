<h1>Film & Digital</h1>
<h2>I shoot concert at venues like Aragon Ballroom and Thalia Hall in Chicago in addition to taking film portraits and landscape shots in my free time. The bulk of my film photography is a love letter to Califronia, tall, tall trees and people living in spectacular moments.</h2>
