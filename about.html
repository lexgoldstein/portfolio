<div id="content"><h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Lex Goldstein. I'm a student journalist and social media content manager based in Evanston at Northwestern University. My roots run deep on the West Coast, having grown up among the tall Redwoods of Northern California. I am a passionate creative dedicated to thoughtful, boundary-pushing storytelling and have covered everything from a city shaped by its Methodist roots to a sweeping trend bike theft and improv troupes.</p>
    
    <p>I juggle a variety of roles in the broader media field. For Northwestern Admissions, I craft Instagram posts and Reels for our 29,000+ followers of prospective and current students, parents and alumni. In the evenings, you can find me in The Daily Northwestern newsroom as a print managing editor. Previously, I held editing roles on the Arts & Entertainment, Audience Engagement and Campus desks, as well as the religion and spirituality beat for the City desk. For STITCH Magazine, Northwestern's fashion publication, I write articles on trends. A change of setting puts me in Stanislaus National Forest, where I spent the past two summers blogging and photographing summer camp magic in the woods.</p>
    
    <p>My years of experience in media — editorial, social media, audience engagement — as well as a tested skillset in the Adobe and Microsoft suites will lead me into a future career of storytelling. There are stories all around us waiting to be told, and I do not intend to let my pen ink dry out. </p>
